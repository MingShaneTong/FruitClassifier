\section{Abstract}

A Convolutional Neural Network was created to classify if an image contained a cherry, strawberry or tomato. This used a training set of 3000 images, a validation set of 600 images and a testing set of 900 images. The final model achieved and accuracy of 80.77\%, a better result than the Multi Layer Perceptron model which achieved an accuracy of 37.89\%. This paper will explore Image Classification, Convolutional Neural Networks and techniques for tuning these model.
